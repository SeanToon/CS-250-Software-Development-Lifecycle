The Gaming Room is a client that wants to expand their game onto various operating systems. My job was to explain different architecture plans to integrate the clients game in a distributed environment and for the different operating platforms available. The client wants a web-based game that serves multiple platforms, named Draw it or lose it. The software requirements for the application are that the game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved, each team will have multiple players assigned, game and team names must be unique, and only one game can exist in memory at a time. 
I think I did particularly well with offering plenty of information about the abilities of each operating platform. Working through the design document was helpful when developing the code because it was a guide that made working through the project a step by step process, making the process easier and more effiecent. If I was to revise and improve one part of my work, it would be the recomondation section. I think it would be a good idea to keep doing research aobut what OS would truly be best to use for the applicaiton.
I interpreted the user's needs in the software design by including information about different operating systems, I restated the clients needs and the linked the info and features that each operating system had to the needs of the client to show the best possible options. This is important because the client's needs will need to be met and when you show a client a design template that is something that needs to be absolutely clear. In the future I will definitely be using a premade software design template to guide my project.
