How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs are the needs that shall be met when designing a system. There are many different ways to collect user needs such as interviews or any kind of interaction or feedback from users of a system. One method that is helpful to gather user needs is creating "user stories". Creating "User stories" puts a programmer or designer in the postion of a user to determine possible user-system interactions. Having the right "user stories" helps developers implement all of the necessary system requirements. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

There are many different Software Development Lifecyle approaches that can be used as a map for developing a system; two of the most famous being an agile approach and a waterfall approach. An agile approach allows for flexiblity with project development, while a waterfall approach does not. An agile approach has a overarching development plan from the beginning of a project but can be changed at any phase of the development lifecycle. A waterfall approach also has an overarching development plan for the beginning of a project but it cannot be changed during middle phases of the development lifecycle. The approach that shall be taken depends on the context of the project. For example, if a project is large, complex and intuitively difficult, the best approach may be an agile development approach. If a project is short and simple a waterfall approach may be the best approach. I hope that with my future projects, I will be able to determine what approach will work best for specific needs.
